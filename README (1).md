An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).
This repository contains the implementation of a Motivational Speaker Chatbot. The application uses Gradio for the user interface, Hugging Face's Inference API for generating responses, PyMuPDF for extracting text from a PDF, and FAISS for vector search. The chatbot aims to inspire and support users on their journey to discovering their purpose and achieving their goals.
